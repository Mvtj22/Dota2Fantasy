                ✔ I decided that barracks aren't towers @done (10/2/2023, 12:33:37 PM)
        
        Blue:
            - Wards Placed: 145 per each
                ✔ Do sentries count? @done (10/2/2023, 12:33:29 PM)
                - No
            - Camps Stacked: 225 each
            - Runes Grabbed: 105 per rune grabbed
                ✔ Counts wisdom runes and gold runes? @done (10/2/2023, 12:33:09 PM)

            - Watchers Taken: 235 per watcher captured

                ✔ Need to get last hit? Yes @done (10/1/2023, 7:38:34 PM)
            - Teamfight Participation: Max 1835 for Participation in Teamfight
                ☐ How is this calculated
            - Stuns: 20 per second of stun
            - Tormentor Kills: 875 per Tormentor killed
                ✔ Need to get last hit? @done (10/6/2023, 2:58:17 PM)
            - Courier Kills: 855 per courier
            - First Blood: 2000 if FirstBlood

        ✔ Check the average stats for each player, and role for each stat. @done (10/6/2023, 8:08:53 PM)
        ☐ How big is the difference between winning and losing, should I pick players I think will win.
            - Only 2 of 3 Matches count, and only one series a day.

    Emblem Quality:
        - Tier 1: 10%
        - Tier 2: 30%
        - Tier 3: 60%
        - Tier 4: 100%
        - Tier 5: 150%
        ✔ Do calculations to see on average rolling on each tier what %gain you will get. @done (9/29/2023, 12:52:37 PM)
            - Pretty sure you can roll a worse Quality but not the same lvl
            - 75% avg improvement at tier 1
            - 50% avg improvement at tier 2
            - 12.5% avg improvement at tier 3
            - -37.5% avg improvement at tier 4

            - Basically Roll if Tier 3 and under only


    Emblem Traits:
        - Incorruptible is worthless
        ☐ For adjacency calculations we need to consider if percentages are equal maybe one color, stat is way better?
            - Benevolent is 20% to adjacent so 40% in middle, 20% on sides.
            - Vampiric is 50% on it, -10% on adjacent so 30% in middle, 40% on sides.
        - Unique is 30% if only one, this is worthless compared to adjacencies.
        - Friendly is 50% if 3 Friendly Traits. So by far the best but you need all three.

        Best Traits:
            - Friendly (if all 3). 50%
            - Vampiric on Sides or Benevolent in middle. 40%
            - Vampiric in middle or Unique if only one. 30%
            - Benevolent on sides. 20%
            - Incorruptible is trash.

    Other:
        - Changing players does not change banners.

                    100% of teamfights = 100%
